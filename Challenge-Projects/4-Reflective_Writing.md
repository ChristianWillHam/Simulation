## Due December 11

## Description

Answer the following questions below, which are all about connecting the content of this course to your broader education and long-term plans.

There are no right or wrong answers, but focus on interrogating your own experiences and bringing depth to your reflections. You can draw 
on any other experiences or sources that are helpful in answering the questions. Write at least one decent-length paragraph for each question;
your full set of answers will probably be 2-3 pages.

## Questions

1. Think back to how you felt at the beginning of the course. What were your expectations?

        In all honesty, thinking back to the beginning of the course, I was not expecting it to be as challenging as it was. I had a lot of 
    problematic stuff going on in my personal life this semester, but thats just how its been lately. I was also initially excited and intimidated
    at the thought of learning a new language. 

2. Tell a story about a topic, problem, or assignment from the class that challenged you. How did you respond?

        I had two significant challenges this semester, exclusively with the course work for this class.
        The first challenge happened after I finished the first sprint. Learning my way around Python was pretty rough, but I got the hang of it
    A bit better over time, but the challenge lie in submitting my work. My Mimir IDE was not synching with Githu, so when I tried to push
    my work I would consistently get errors, or if not errors, the commit and push would appear to work, however when I went on Github to make
    a pull request, none of my work would be there. I reached out to you once, but did not hear back and ended up letting it slide to the point
    where it was unreasonible to request to submit late. Your reply to my email asking how to submit Sprint 2, was really an awakening and the
    tone provided the motivation I needed to "figure it out" myself. I ended up spending about three days familiarizing myself with VS Code and
    and installing everything necessairy for the class and to make code run. I had a better time trying to submit my work, but only managed to 
    be able to submit smoothly very late in the semester when I realized that there was a desktop Github application. This whole experience helped
    me rely on others less. I had trouble with something I had no idea to do, and eventually after sitting down with the issue for an expended period
    of time and doing lots of research, I was able to get past the problem.
        The second significant challenge I had in this class was the Fast Pass Sprint. I worked through the problem using your resources within about
    three or four days, however I made the mistake of overestimating the skill I had gained in Python. I ended up spending around 20 wasted hours on
    trying to pass different percentage of fastpass owner values into my tagging function. No matter what I did I was not able to pass the values.
    Finally I ditched the strategy I was using and, instead, used a global variable instead of trying to pass to a fucntion directly. Although this was
    a fairly simple issue, I was so frustrated and so close to giving up on the project entirely, but eventually I was able to make the program run
    and managed to make the program operate using the passed values. Again, I learned how to rely on myself more and adapt to challenges I reached. 

3. Tell a story about an interaction you had with another person because of this class.

        I've had several fantastic interactions with other students because of this class. One of the best interactions, however I can say I've
    had because of this was an interaction with Fritz. We were stuying in the same buiding at the same time of day and I saw him and we ended up
    talking for quite a while. I wanted to see how he had done on one of the quizzes that I did not do well on, but our conversation ended up 
    seguaying deep into surfing, which we both love.

4. Other than programming, what have you learned from this class that you can take forward into your other classes or post-Rollins work?

        This class has helped me vastly increase my adaptability, self-sufficiency, and problem-solving skills. These skills, I believe, will
    help me vastly in my future classes, and in any future jobs I may have.

5. What has been your experience on learning during the pandemic, whether that was in-person or remote? What did you find most challenging? What (if anything) worked well for you during this time?

        The whole quarentine has been extremly bad for my mental health and my academics. My days are dominated by an overall sense of impending doom, 
    and the feeling that everything is slipping further and further into the unknown - this also coupled by the feeling that nothing is real. Over this
    time, my saving grace has been meditation and working out. While the pandemic was at its worst towards the beginning, I was not able to work out for a very long time, and that wrought havock on my mental health and physical health, so I ended up getting into meditation. It has halped me immensely.
    Also once I got back to campus, I was able to start working out again - both of these have helped me stay anchored more strongly to reality and keep
    me from falling into my habit of nihilistic, fatilistic thought patterns. 

6. What are your thoughts on online vs. in-person education? Do you think there are positive aspects of online teaching that we should
incorporate into our regular classes?

        I greately appreciate the relative flexability of online classes. I benefit from having an in person class environment, however there were several
    days when my mental health was bad and I was having a hard time finding the motivation to get out of bed, or I was just feeling under the weather
    and I did not need to miss class.

7. *Metacognition* is the act of thinking about your own thinking. **The single most important skill you can develop in college is
self-awareness about your own learning process**. What have learned about your own learning as a result of being in this class?

        I have learned that I am persisant. I may not be an excellent programmer, or a good academic performer, however I am persistent. Given time, I
    will figure anything out weather or not I have help from others. I feel I often sell myself short, however if I really pour time into something and
    get over the idea that I have a life outside my work then evenually I will come up with a decent end product.
